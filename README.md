Web development
---------------

I'm convinced that great software transforms our lives. So this year I
decided to turn my love of good software into real code.

I started with a six week part-time online course from UCBerkeleyX, then I
devoted three months to learning how to code at [Makers Academy]. I grasp
new ideas quickly and would like to broaden my skills as a full stack
web developer.
